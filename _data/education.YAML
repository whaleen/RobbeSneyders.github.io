degrees:
  - title: Master of Mechanical Engineering, Mechatronics and Robotics
    school: University of Leuven
    period: 2015 - 2017
    description: >
      My master focusses on the challenges lying ahead in the domain 
      of robotics and mechatronics, in which machines should be able 
      to interact with their environment and with each other. 
      Key aspects are optimization, decision making methods based on
      intelligent sensor processing, and architectural composition 
      patterns of systems of systems.

  - title: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering with Minor in Electrical Engineering
    school: University of Leuven
    period: 2011 - 2015
    description: >
      In my bachelor, I acquired a strong theoretical understanding 
      of both mathematics and physics, and a problem solving mindset.
      I chose for a focus on mechanics and electronics, which gave me
      a deeper understanding of mechanics of materials, fluid dynamics, 
      thermodynamics, and electromechanics.

thesis:
  - title: Usage Pattern Prediction by Matrix Decomposition
    school: University of Leuven
    period: 2016 - 2017
    description: >
      People display certain patterns when using appliances. The goal
      of my thesis is to assess the potential of machine learning 
      methods based on matrix decomposition to predict these patterns.
      A basic understanding of general machine learning methods is 
      needed to evaluate the results by comparison.

courses:
  - title: "Athens Course: Operational Research"
    school: "Technical University of Lisbon"
    period: "November 2016"
    description: >
      In the context of the Athens Programme, I followed a course 
      on operational research at the Technical University of Lisbon.
      Operational research aims to find optimal or near-optimal 
      solutions to complex decision-making problems.

  - title: "Athens Course: Spectral Signatures - from Foods to Fuels"
    school: "Technical University of Madrid"
    period: "November 2015"
    description: >
      In the context of the Athens Programme, I followed a course 
      on spectroscopy at the Technical University of Madrid.
      Spectroscopy is a non-invasive technique used to identify
      and characterize materials by studying the interaction between 
      the material and electromagnetic radiation.

  - title: "Online Course: CS50: Introduction to Computer Science"
    school: "Harvard University"
    period: "January 2017"
    description: >
      Most of my knowledge about computer science has been 
      self-taught. I followed the CS50 course online to get an
      overview of the computer science fundamentals and fill in
      any gaps in my knowledge.
